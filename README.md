# Weather React App

## Description

This is a single-page web application for searching city-based weather forecasts built using [React](https://react.dev/). 

It allows users to type in a city into the search bar which prompts the display of a dynamically updated list of all results relative to the specified city. This project was completed with the aim of becoming familiar with using React to make API calls.
